# NotaApplication
This is my first backend project.
Nota api,
I created Nota server using Node js and express, I managed to make the basic CRUD operations, I also used some useful liberaries; memstorage to save data locally, and sequential-ids to create sequence of notes ids, I used body_parser library to parse Json objects, I applied my test requests on Postman.
